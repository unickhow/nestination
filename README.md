# Nestination

The JSON Key Finder is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to enhance your workflow by providing easy navigation through JSON files. This extension offers a quick search functionality to locate keys in your JSON, no matter how deeply nested they are. When a specific key is searched, the view is centered and highlighted, providing an instant visual cue to the key's location in the code.
